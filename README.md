BZlag Plugin Starter
===================

A small and quick tool that will generate the skeleton of a BZFlag plugin for someone to simply add code to the body. The live website is located [here](http://allejo.me/misc/bzflag-plugin-starter/) and if you would like to host your own version, simply clone the repo and upload it.
