BZFlag Plugin Starter
=====================

This plugin starter is a tool that will generate the skeleton of a BZFlag plugin for someone to simply fill in the blanks with their own code. The official website is located [here](http://allejo.me/misc/bzflag-plugin-starter/) and if you would like to host your own version, simply clone the repo and upload it to your own web server.

This tool will not write the functionality for a plugin, it will only generate the skeleton of the plugin so the developer does not have to waste time setting up all the events or slash commands.
